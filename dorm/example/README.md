Here's an example of a fictional database schema that incorporates various elements such as tables,
relationships, composite columns, and polymorphic tables:

1. Users table:
    - userId (primary key)
    - username
    - email
    - profile (composite column with sub-attributes like name, age and bio)

2. Products table:
    - productId (primary key)
    - name
    - description
    - price

3. Orders table:
    - orderId (primary key)
    - userId (foreign column referencing Users table)
    - orderDate
    - totalAmount

4. OrderItems table:
    - orderId (foreign column referencing Orders table)
    - productId (foreign column referencing Products table)
    - quantity

5. Reviews table:
    - reviewId (primary key)
    - reviewText
    - reviewDate

      - product: productRating, productFeatures, and productRecommendation
      - service: serviceRating, serviceQuality, and serviceExperience

Relationships:
- One-to-One: Users table relates to Orders table in a one-to-one relationship, indicating that each
  user can have only one order.

  have multiple reviews.
- Many-to-Many: Orders table relates to Products table in a many-to-many relationship through the 
  OrderItems table, where multiple products can be associated with a single order and vice versa.

Types of Queries:
1. Retrieve user information, including their associated orders and profile details.
2. Get all products in an order, along with their quantities.
3. Fetch all orders placed by a specific user.
